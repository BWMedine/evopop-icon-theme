#EvoPop Icon Theme Guidelines
=====================
These are some simple guidelines we use in order to have a cohesive icon pack.
To put it simple we use [google material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#icons-product-icons) with some alterations.

1. Free shapes: we don't stick to uniform shapes! Corners are however rounded as subscribed.
2. We keep our icons simple & flat
3. We don't use shadows expect for:
  - The tinded & shaded edges (0.5 height)
  - The lightning layer at a 45Â° angle
4. We try to stick to [gmd colors](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html)
5. There is no need to try & reinvent a good flat icon


========================================================

###Actual files
- Scalable icons are made on a 48px grid & have a gap of 2 pixels between the icon & the end of the grid.
- If needed (unsharp images) a seperate fixed png file is made for 16x16 24x24 or 32x32
